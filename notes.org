* General Knowledge                                                 :general:

** browser pluggin to handle accounts: metaMask

** local test network: Ganache(former TestRPC)
*** Account creation
    the Ganache package creates a set of unprotected
    accounts that can be used while testing

** remote test network: Rinkeby

** javascript testing framework used: mocha


* Solidity knowledge                                               :solidity:

** solidity compiler: solc

** Compiling solidity code results in diferent components:

*** ABI (Application Binary Interface) (abiDefinition)

*** Code (EVM bytecode):                                           :ethereum:
    The code that is actualy deployed and executed in the blockchain

*** Other General information about the contract:
**** source code
**** language
**** language version
**** compiler version
**** userDoc
**** developerDoc

* Ethereum knowledge                                               :ethereum:

** Contract deployment
   The bytecode resulting from the compilation of solidity code
   can be deployed to the blockchain as a smartcontract.

   In order to deploy a contract we can run our own node to get
   access to the network or use a service like infura (infura.io).


** TODO Transaction

* Glossary

** ABI:                                                            :solidity:
   The interface between contracts in the ethereum ecosystem,
   both from the outside and contract-to-contract interaction

** Web3:                                                         :blockchain:
   Library to get programatic access to a deployed contract.
   Interacts with a provider, wich in turn interacts with a network
*** Web3 0.x.x <- more primitive interface, only callbacks for async code
*** Web3 1.x.x <- support for promises + async/await

** EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine):                                 :ethereum:
   Is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum.
   It is the fundamental consensus mechanism for Ethereum.

** Provider:                                   :solidity:blockchain:ethereum:
   The communication layer with the blockchain.
   Instructs web3 about the network it is connected to as well
   as what accounts it is connected to.

*** WebsocketProvider

*** HttpProvider

*** IpcProvider

** Smart Contract (also refered as contract):             :ethereum:solidity:
   A computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify
   or enforce the negotiation or performance of an arrangement
   between two or more parties

** TODO Network (as in main vs tests):                             :ethereum:
